Hi there!

So you want to build a game with the Incremental Game Template? Well you're at the right address!
In this tutorial we will take the [igt-vue](https://github.com/123ishaTest/igt-vue) repo and start building a demo game.

## Requirements
I assume you are already familiar with the following things, as they will not be explained here:

- Git/GitHub
- Vue
- Typescript

## What we're going to build
We are going to create a simple Banana-themed game that utilizes the most important Features and Tools.
Currencies, Upgrades, Settings, Statistics, Achievements, our banana game will have it all!
