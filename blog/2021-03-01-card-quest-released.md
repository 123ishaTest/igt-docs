The r/incremental_games 2021 just finished, and I'm happy to announce my submission [Card Quest](https://ishad.itch.io/card-quest) turned out pretty fun!

It also marks a nice milestone for the IGT, as it withstood the challenge of a 7-day game jam.

I have lots of functionality to backport to the template, so expect some good stuff coming soon!
