Hello interested reader. Welcome to the Incremental Game Template.

My name is Isha. I have been developing incremental games since 2014. Most of them bad, some of them good.

Over the years I have developed certain features over and over for different games.
Stuff like upgrades, currencies and such.
This project aims to develop the 'final' version of these features, such that everyone can take advantage of them.


## What is this project
To gain the most out of this project, it is important to know what it is about exactly.

#### It is
- A collection of useful scripts that will help you get start very quickly
- Inspiration on how to implement things every game needs

#### It is not
- A tutorial on how to develop games
- A game engine
- A library
- A guarantee for a good game. You still need to create interesting mechanics yourself :)


## Personal Preferences
I am by no means a programming expert. It is a fun hobby that I picked up while studying Computer Science.
Many, many choices in this template are made arbitrarily and might not be the optimal way to do things.
Feel free to contact me if you have some good ideas :)
