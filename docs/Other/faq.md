#### Q: Do you have script X available in language Y?
I'm still working on a way to neatly include multiple languages into a single project.
Unity C# has been requested a few times.
A new Unity project could be setup or simple scripts could be included in the TS repo.

#### Q: Cool project, can I help?
A: Yes! You can. Translating the features into C# would be a huge help!
